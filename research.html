<p class="secondadjust">My research is aimed at using virtual reality (VR) technologies that would be designed to support those students who struggle with the foundational
     skills of phonological awareness, decoding, comprehension, spelling, and composition. The multiple experiential dimensions 
    afforded by VR technology gives children the opportunity to create and experience literacy practices with a deeper, more fully embodied perspective.
    Such an immersive experience would arguably maximize the noted benefits of tactile, hands-on strategies used in traditional
     literacy programs like Lindamood Bell. The unique aspect of this project under development is that we include children 
     (two 10 year-olds for the time being) as important co-researchers who weigh in on what they like, what preferences, 
     interests, etc. they have, incorporating this information as we develop the program.
