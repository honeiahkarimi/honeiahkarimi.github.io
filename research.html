    Traveling by Headset: Immersive VR for Language Learning. Computer Assisted Language Instruction Consortium 
    (CALICO) Journal.</p>

<p class="secondadjust">In line with the 2021 CALICO Conference theme “Global Realities,” 
    we presented a plenary on how Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) could be used for second language learning
    by allowing learners to virtually travel around the globe via headset. 
    The main affordances of VR technology include immersing learners in an authentic cultural context almost 
    anywhere on the globe while manifesting a strong sense of presence and enabling learning through embodied cognition, 
    which involves kinesthetic engagement. In this article, we first review current models of immersive learning 
    and note how certain processes of second language and culture learning are missing in these models. 
    Using some examples of IVR apps for L2 learning, we discuss the research to date that focuses on the 
    affordances of the technology for languaculture learning and propose how the effectiveness of these apps 
    could be studied, expanding on the cognitive-affective model of immersive learning (CAMIL, 
    proposed by Makransky and Petersen, 2021) to include social factors. 
    We conclude with some recommendations for the development of future immersive VR apps for 
    languaculture learning that follow our expanded theoretical model.
